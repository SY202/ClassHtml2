          <h2>Washington, DC is my hometown and Seoul was my first duty station after joining the Army.
              Later in life, I decided to teach English abroad and lived in both Spain & Russia for a total of 4 years.
              Following that, I moved to the Bay Area to pursue a master's degree and transition back to living stateside.</h2>
